WORKING_SLOT_FILTER_USER_PROMPT = dedent("""
You guard ResearchAgent's long-term memory entrance. Decide if this WorkingSlot deserves promotion into FAISS storage.

Assess four dimensions:
1. Novelty – is this meaningfully new compared to typical research agent discoveries?
2. Utility – can future tasks reuse the insight, metric, procedure, or decision?
3. Stability – will the information stay valid for multiple iterations (i.e., not a transient log)?
4. Evidence – do attachments, metrics, or tags provide concrete support?

Return `yes` only when at least two dimensions are clearly satisfied or the slot closes a critical loop (e.g., root-causing a failure, finishing a checklist item). Otherwise return `no`.

STRICT OUTPUT: respond with a single lowercase word: `yes` or `no`. Do not explain.

WORKING_SLOT_ROUTE_USER_PROMPT = dedent("""
Map this WorkingSlot to the correct ResearchAgent long-term memory family. Choose EXACTLY one label:

- semantic → enduring insights, generalized conclusions, reusable heuristics.
- episodic → Situation → Action → Result traces with metrics, timestamps, or narrative context.
- procedural → MUST provide "when to use", and OPTIONAL reproducible steps, commands, pipelines, or interface contracts that express "how to".

Tie-breaking rules:
- Prefer episodic if a chronological action/result trail exists, even if insights appear.
- Prefer procedural when explicit steps/tools/commands are primary.
- Otherwise output semantic.

Return only one of: "semantic", "episodic", "procedural".

Merge the provided WorkingSlots into ONE distilled WorkingSlot suitable for the short-term queue.

Requirements:
- Remove duplicate facts while keeping supporting metrics or attachments that future agents might need.
- Surface causal links (Situation → Action → Result) whenever present.
- Normalize tags to 1–4 lowercase tokens.
- Keep summary ≤150 words; emphasize reusable, stable insights spanning research, execution, and follow-up actions.
- If attachments include command snippets, metrics, or notes, fold only the most representative subset into the compressed slot.

You aggregate episodic traces into a single semantic memory entry. Capture the durable lesson that explains why the cluster exists.

Instructions:
- Highlight causal mechanisms, success/failure thresholds, and metrics that repeatedly appeared.
- Mention representative stages (e.g., experiment_execute) only if they add meaning.
- Provide tags that cover both domain concepts and process cues (e.g., ["vision","fog","stability"]).
- Return STRICT JSON containing `summary`, `detail`, `tags`.

Convert the WorkingSlot JSON into a concise human-readable paragraph (no tags, no JSON). This summary feeds chat surfaces, not FAISS.

Guidance:
- Mention stage, topic, and the core outcome or decision.
- Cite standout metrics or attachments inline (e.g., "accuracy climbed to 0.73").
- Describe actionable next steps only if explicitly recorded.
- Limit to 2–4 sentences; avoid bulleting or markdown.

Convert the Experiment Agent workflow context into at most {max_slots} WorkingSlot entries ready for filtering/routing.

Context Snapshot:
<workflow-context>

Authoring rules:
1. Each slot MUST capture a single reusable takeaway (decision, discovery, bottleneck, or command).
2. `stage` MUST be one of: pre_analysis, code_plan, code_implement, code_judge, experiment_execute, experiment_analysis, meta.
3. `summary` follows Situation → Action → Result whenever data exists; keep ≤130 words.
4. `topic` is a 3–6 word slug referencing the problem space.
5. `attachments` is optional but, when present, group similar info under keys such as
   - "notes": {{"items": []}}
   - "metrics": {{}}
   - "issues": {{"list": []}}
   - "actions": {{"list": []}}
6. `tags` is a list of lowercase keywords (≤5 items) mixing domain + workflow hints.
7. If the context lacks meaningful content, return `"slots": []` but keep the envelope.
